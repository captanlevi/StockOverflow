The following rules apply for strategies for single stock

1) A stock can only be shorted if you are not holding any currently.
2) If a buy action is executed, we first check for any shorted stock and square them off first.

These conditions combined mean that in your portfolio you may have multiple bought stocks or multiple shorted stocks but NOT BOTH.

3) In case you are holding multiple stocks (not shorted but bought)
    When a sell action is executed the stock bought at the lowest price will be sold at the current closing price.

4) All trades execute at the closing price.

5) Shorted stocks must be squared the same day !!!!!
